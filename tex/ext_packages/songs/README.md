This directory contains the needed files from the songs package:

   - `songs.sty`: the songs package, a required file for compiling the songbook
   - `songidx.lua`: used in creating indices, a required file for compiling
                    the songbook

The full songs package distribution is found in `miscellaneous/ext_package_songs_distribution/`
under the project's root, containing documentation and samples. The files above
are extracted from that package.
